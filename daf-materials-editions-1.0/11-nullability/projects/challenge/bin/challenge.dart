/// children. It would be difficult to create a data class to accurately
/// represent them all, but try it like this:
///
/// - Create a class called `Name` with `givenName` and `surname` properties.
/// - Some people write the surname last and some write it first. Add a
///   Boolean property called `surnameIsFirst` to keep track of this.
/// - Not everyone in the world has a surname.
/// - Add a `toString` method that prints the full name.
