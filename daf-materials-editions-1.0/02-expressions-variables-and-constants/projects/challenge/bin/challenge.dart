  /// your best friend's age.

  /// Challenge 2: Make it compile
  ///
  /// Given the following code:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// age = 16;
  /// print(age);
  /// age = 30;
  /// print(age);
  /// ```

  /// `final` or `const`?

  // from the value.

  ///
  /// ```
  /// const x = 46;
  /// const y = 10;

  /// ```

  /// const answer2 = (x * 100) + (y * 100);
  /// const answer3 = (x * 100) + (y / 10);
  /// ```

  /// A quadratic equation is something of the form

  /// The values of `x` which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation
  ///
  /// `x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a)`.
  ///
  /// Declare three constants named `a`, `b` and `c` of type `double`. Then
  /// calculate the two values for `x` using the equation above (noting that
  /// the `±` means plus or minus, so one value of `x` for each). Store the
  /// results in constants called `root1` and `root2` of type `double`.
